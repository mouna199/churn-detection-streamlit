# Churn Prediction Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a Churn Prediction project using data from a telecom company. The goal of the project is to predict customer churn and implement a predictive model. 

The entire workflow involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model training, and deployment on a web application using Streamlit.

The deployed application is accessible https://churn-prediction-mouna.streamlit.app/.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several main steps:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** The `EDA_telco_churn copy.ipynb` notebook provides a detailed analysis of the telecom dataset. Exploratory Data Analysis is crucial for understanding the structure and characteristics of the data.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** The `Model.ipynb` notebook covers the data preprocessing steps, In addition to training a churn prediction model. I used a simple model for the case of simplicity at first.

3. **Model Deployment:** The `predict.py` is the code for deploying the trained model using Streamlit. The web application allows users to input customer information and receive predictions regarding the likelihood of churn.
